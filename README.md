# VoiceAssistant

The basic idea behind this project is to create a voice assistant that helps less tech savy people to communicate with computer. Voice assistant determines what a user wants to do by identifying the user intent from spoken or textual input by utterance. It is a very useful tool for search, reminders, opening and saving the applications we need. The new version consists of 3 new features.They are movie recommender, book recommender and covid protection. Also, through this voice assistant, we can open the applications we want, that is no need to search them and also time saving, also we can play videos, songs.

According to the user interests,voice assistant gives response to the user. A movie recommender also includes series recommender too, like online web series. These are displayed to the user according to the IMDB ratings and number of users watched it. The same idea applies with book recommender also, the books are displayed according to user interests like their favourite author, genres, thriller etc. As we can see that, there is rapid spread of covid-19 everywhere and precautions are to be taken. In this, all the symptoms of covid-19 are stored and through this, we can know, whether the user has covid symptoms or not and also suggests the precautions to be taken.
